## 1. Building Blocks

*Using the 3-pipeline design, this is what you will learn to build within this course* ↓

### 1.1. Training Pipeline 

Training pipeline that:
- loads a proprietary Q&A dataset 
- fine-tunes an open-source LLM using QLoRA
- logs the training experiments on [Comet ML's](https://www.comet.com?utm_source=thepauls&utm_medium=partner&utm_content=github) experiment tracker & the inference results on [Comet ML's](https://www.comet.com?utm_source=thepauls&utm_medium=partner&utm_content=github) LLMOps dashboard
- stores the best model on [Comet ML's](https://www.comet.com/site/products/llmops/?utm_source=thepauls&utm_medium=partner&utm_content=github) model registry

The **training pipeline** is **deployed** using [Beam](https://docs.beam.cloud/getting-started/quickstart?utm_source=thepauls&utm_medium=partner&utm_content=github) as a serverless GPU infrastructure.

-> Found under the `modules/training_pipeline` directory.

#### 💻 Minimum Hardware Requirements
* CPU: 4 Cores
* RAM: 14 GiB
* VRAM: 10 GiB (mandatory CUDA-enabled Nvidia GPU)

**Note:** Do not worry if you don't have the minimum hardware requirements. We will show you how to deploy the training pipeline to [Beam's](https://docs.beam.cloud/getting-started/quickstart?utm_source=thepauls&utm_medium=partner&utm_content=github) serverless infrastructure and train the LLM there.

### 1.2. Streaming Real-time Pipeline

Real-time feature pipeline that:
- ingests financial news from [Alpaca](https://alpaca.markets/docs/api-references/market-data-api/news-data/)
- cleans & transforms the news documents into embeddings in real-time using [Bytewax](https://github.com/bytewax/bytewax?utm_source=thepauls&utm_medium=partner&utm_content=github)
- stores the embeddings into the [Qdrant Vector DB](https://qdrant.tech/?utm_source=thepauls&utm_medium=partner&utm_content=github)

The **streaming pipeline** is **automatically deployed** on an AWS EC2 machine using a CI/CD pipeline built in GitHub actions.

-> Found under the `modules/streaming_pipeline` directory.

#### 💻 Minimum Hardware Requirements
* CPU: 1 Core
* RAM: 2 GiB
* VRAM: -

### 1.3. Inference Pipeline

Inference pipeline that uses [LangChain](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain) to create a chain that:
* downloads the fine-tuned model from [Comet's](https://www.comet.com?utm_source=thepauls&utm_medium=partner&utm_content=github) model registry
* takes user questions as input
* queries the [Qdrant Vector DB](https://qdrant.tech/?utm_source=thepauls&utm_medium=partner&utm_content=github) and enhances the prompt with related financial news
* calls the fine-tuned LLM for financial advice using the initial query, the context from the vector DB, and the chat history
* persists the chat history into memory 
* logs the prompt & answer into [Comet ML's](https://www.comet.com/site/products/llmops/?utm_source=thepauls&utm_medium=partner&utm_content=github) LLMOps monitoring feature

The **inference pipeline** is **deployed** using [Beam](https://docs.beam.cloud/deployment/rest-api?utm_source=thepauls&utm_medium=partner&utm_content=github) as a serverless GPU infrastructure, as a RESTful API. Also, it is wrapped under a UI for demo purposes, implemented in [Gradio](https://www.gradio.app/).

-> Found under the `modules/financial_bot` directory.

#### 💻 Minimum Hardware Requirements
* CPU: 4 Cores
* RAM: 14 GiB
* VRAM: 8 GiB (mandatory CUDA-enabled Nvidia GPU)

**Note:** Do not worry if you don't have the minimum hardware requirements. We will show you how to deploy the inference pipeline to [Beam's](https://docs.beam.cloud/getting-started/quickstart?utm_source=thepauls&utm_medium=partner&utm_content=github) serverless infrastructure and call the LLM from there.

#### 1.4. Financial Q&A Dataset

We used `GPT3.5` to generate a financial Q&A dataset to fine-tune our open-source LLM to specialize in using financial terms and answering financial questions. Using a large LLM, such as `GPT3.5` to generate a dataset that trains a smaller LLM (e.g., Falcon 7B) is known as **fine-tuning with distillation**. 

→ To understand how we generated the financial Q&A dataset, [check out this article](https://open.substack.com/pub/paulabartabajo/p/how-to-generate-financial-q-and-a?r=1ttoeh&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web) written by [Pau Labarta](https://github.com/Paulescu).

→ To see a complete analysis of the financial Q&A dataset, check out the [dataset_analysis](https://github.com/ishai-rosenberg/hands-on-llms/blob/main/dataset_analysis) subsection of the course written by [Alexandru Razvant](https://github.com/Joywalker).

## 2. Setup External Services

Before diving into the modules, you have to set up a couple of additional external tools for the course.

**NOTE:** You can set them up as you go for every module, as we will point you in every module what you need.

### 2.1. Alpaca
`financial news data source`

Follow this [document](https://alpaca.markets/docs/market-data/getting-started/) to show you how to create a FREE account and generate the API Keys you will need within this course.

**Note:** 1x Alpaca data connection is FREE.

### 2.2. Qdrant
`serverless vector DB`

Go to [Qdrant](https://qdrant.tech/?utm_source=thepauls&utm_medium=partner&utm_content=github) and create a FREE account.

After, follow [this document](https://qdrant.tech/documentation/cloud/authentication/?utm_source=thepauls&utm_medium=partner&utm_content=github) on how to generate the API Keys you will need within this course.

**Note:** We will use only Qdrant's freemium plan. 

### 2.3. Comet ML
`serverless ML platform`

Go to [Comet ML](https://www.comet.com/signup?utm_source=thepauls&utm_medium=partner&utm_content=github) and create a FREE account.

After, [follow this guide](https://www.comet.com/docs/v2/guides/getting-started/quickstart/) to generate an API KEY and a new project, which you will need within the course.

**Note:** We will use only Comet ML's freemium plan. 

### 2.4. Beam
`serverless GPU compute | training & inference pipelines`

Go to [Beam](https://www.beam.cloud?utm_source=thepauls&utm_medium=partner&utm_content=github) and create a FREE account.

After, you must follow their [installation guide](https://docs.beam.cloud/getting-started/installation?utm_source=thepauls&utm_medium=partner&utm_content=github) to install their CLI & configure it with your Beam credentials.

To read more about Beam, here is an [introduction guide](https://docs.beam.cloud/getting-started/introduction?utm_source=thepauls&utm_medium=partner&utm_content=github).

**Note:** Beam new API broke the possibility to run this code using Beam, as mentioned [here](https://github.com/iusztinpaul/hands-on-llms/issues/86). If you have an Nvidia GPU >8 GB VRAM & don't want to deploy the training & inference pipelines, you can run the training and inference pipelines locally. Otherwise, you'll have to run it on an GPU-enabled AWS on-demand instance, e.g., g4dn.2xlarge. See the instances prices [here](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/). 

#### Troubleshooting

When using Poetry, we had issues locating the Beam CLI inside a Poetry virtual environment. To fix this, after installing Beam, we create a symlink that points to Poetry's binaries, as follows:
 ```shell
  export COURSE_MODULE_PATH=<your-course-module-path> # e.g., modules/training_pipeline
  cd $COURSE_MODULE_PATH
  export POETRY_ENV_PATH=$(dirname $(dirname $(poetry run which python)))

  ln -s /usr/local/bin/beam ${POETRY_ENV_PATH}/bin/beam
 ```


 ### 2.5. AWS
 `cloud compute | feature pipeline`

 Go to [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/console/), create an account, and generate a pair of credentials.

 After, download and install their [AWS CLI v2.11.22](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html) and [configure it](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-configure.html) with your credentials.

 **Note:** You will pay only for what you use. You will deploy only a `t2.small` EC2 VM, which is only `~$0.023` / hour. If you don't want to deploy the feature pipeline, using AWS is optional.


## 3. Install & Usage
Every module has its dependencies and scripts. In a production setup, every module would have its repository, but in this use case, for learning purposes, we put everything in one place:

Thus, check out the README for every module individually to see how to install & use it:
1. [q_and_a_dataset_generator](/modules/q_and_a_dataset_generator/)
2. [training_pipeline](/modules/training_pipeline/)
3. [streaming_pipeline](/modules/streaming_pipeline/)
4. [inference_pipeline](/modules/financial_bot/)

## 4. Lectures

We strongly encourage you to clone this repository and replicate everything we've done to get the most out of this course.

In each module's video lectures, articles, and README documentation, you will find step-by-step instructions.

Happy learning! 🙏
